# Hi, I'm Patrick (Phuong) Pho

Welcome to my GitHub page. I'm a PhD in Big Data Analytics. My research interest includes learning representation on graph structured data, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.

- [Regularized Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) for improved interpretability of large datasets](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-020-00366-x): We propose a flexible penalization scheme on the SGC to simplify the inference process and facilitate investigation of important features for node classification task
- [Exploring the Value of Nodes with Multicommunity Membership for Classification with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/4/170): We investigate optimal sampling strategies to improve the efficiency of GNNs.
- [Exploring a link between network topology and active learning
](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9528662): We conduct simulation study on sampling process and propose indicative guildlines to select optimal sampling strategy for the SGC
- [Link prediction with Simple Graph Convolution and regularized Simple Graph Convolution](http://www.icisdm.org/index.html): We adopt the regularized SGC for link prediction task
